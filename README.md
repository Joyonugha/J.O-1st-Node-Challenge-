J.O-1st-Node-Challenge

Description

I have created a High Level and Professional ReadMe generator that is also connected to its own repository @https://joyonugha.github.io/J.O-ReadMe-Generator/ for the purpose of demonstrating the functionality of a high level ReadMe for interested users. I have also saved the demo as "Sample ReadMe" in this repository. It includes all the necessary sections that should be found on a professional ReadMe and it allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. This has been created from the command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the inquirer package.

Usage

I have created a walkthrough video that shows its functionality Video
You can use this App by following all the instructions given in the "Sample ReadME" file.
